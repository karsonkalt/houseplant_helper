Houseplant helper is a Ruby on Rails web application used to track how often you water your houseplants, keep notes on how they are doing, and get tips on how to take care of your plants. A user can create plants which also belong to a species and edit data that belongs to the logged_in user.


## Architecture and models

Houseplant helper consists of four basic models -- Species, Users, Plants, and Waterings. Plants belong to a Species and a User, and have attributes of their own such as a nickname and water_frequency. Species are pre-loaded into the database on the backend. Users can sign up and login through third party authentication or with their own username and password.

The database is managed through ActiveRecord and layer on ruby methods for additional funcitonality. For example, an instance of Plant can call the method needs_to_be_watered? which will query the database for the most recent watering and return true or false if it has been more than it's water_frequency.


## Development

To get started with Houseplant Helper, run `bundle` from the command line to install all necessary gems. After dependencies have been installed run `rails db:reset` to run the db migrations and seed the database, then run `rails s` from the console to start serving the site to `http://localhost:3000/`. You can then log in with your own information or view a seed account by viewing the User database and selecting a User email and entering the seed password `password`.
