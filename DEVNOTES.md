# Karson's Develoment Notes

# Questions
1. I have a question on nested routes when they use a form partial. The form_with method accepts a model instance, but with nested routes sometimes it will need to also be passed the route. Is there already a solve for this in rails? Or do I need to build out a helper method to generate the route method if its needed?

# Inconsistencies
1. I changed the users form partial to only accept a model, the rest accept both a model and the route.
